When I have a very early morning flight and I have the option to sleep near the airport, I do so. This was the case last week when I was traveling from
Swansea to Gatwick for an early flight to Oslo the next morning. I decided to stay at the Hilton at Gatwick Airport, connected to the South Terminal. 

Now I've stayed at a few Hilton's in my life, but as the years go by, the number decreases (which is also reflected in my status with them). Why? Mainly because I feel many of them desperately need
refurbishment. But this one at Gatwick was different. 

## The Pros

Connected to the South Terminal.

## The Cons

The room I was given was in horrendous condition. Knobs missing from shower, dirty walls, elements missing (as seen in the title picture), filthy chairs, ripped carpets. And worse off, right next to the elevator (which I hate).

I'm not sure what the rest of the rooms are like, but after speaking to the manager and reaching out to them on Social Media, they indicated that
their hotel is in the process of refurbishment. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you for choosing our hotel and please accept our sincere apologies that on this occasion we did not reach expectation. We have sent an email with more details on your issue. We are very pleased to advise that a major refurbishment is planned in the near future.</p>&mdash; Hilton Gatwick (@HiltonGatwick) <a href="https://twitter.com/HiltonGatwick/status/1039450475672883200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 11, 2018</a></blockquote>

Ignoring the horrendous quality of the room, the usual amenities I like such as plugs next to the bed, a decent way to 
switch the lights on and off without having to get out of bed, etc. all missing. 


## The Verdict

*Not recommended*

Given the price I paid (112 GBP without breakfast), it definitely was not worth it. I've stayed at the Holiday Inn Express as well as Premiere Inn at Gatwick and the room
quality was superior, and cost less.

Until they seriously refurbish the place, I definitely won't be staying there again. To their credit, after a series of interactions with them, they have offered me a full refund (after first offering a partial refund). But still, that won't change my mind.

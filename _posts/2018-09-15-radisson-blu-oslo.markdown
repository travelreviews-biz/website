The Sky Bar is something you definitely want to visit.

### The Pros

*Location, Breakfast, Rooms, Bar, Cleansiness*

The hotel is conveniently located near main Oslo S (Central Station) which provides a direct and fast train to the airport for under 200 NOK. 

While the hotel is definitely not new, every time I've stayed there, the rooms have been up to par and it seems that they do take care of making sure they 
refurbish their facilities. 

Some of the newer rooms have a lot of great conveniences like plugs next to the bed, a desk for working on, and coffee/tea amenities. 

The breakfast itself provides good variety. About the only down side is that the tables are often too close together and it's usually quite busy, especially if you're 
there during a conference or event that's held either at the hotel or the Spektrum venue next door (quite popular for events).

Lastly, the Sky Bar on the 34th floor is fantastic. It offers a great view of the city and a relatively OK choice of drinks. But be prepared - it's not only Hotel prices, but Oslo prices, i.e. 140 NOK for a beer.

### The Cons

*Price*

About the only downside is that it's not the cheapest place to stay in Oslo, but if we were to compare it to the average price in Oslo, it's not that expensive.

### Verdict

*Recommended*

It definitely is one of the better places I've stayed at in Oslo and would go back any time.
